👋 Hi there! I'm Daniel Amara 🇧🇷, a 23-year-old coding enthusiast hailing from Brazil, currently pursuing my B-degree at BYU Idaho. By day, I work my Python magic to bring automation to life in a hospital, ensuring efficiency and precision in healthcare.

💡 I'm a versatile developer with a passion for problem-solving. One of my proudest accomplishments was creating a Python program that identifies and automates document management, saving time and resources for my company.

🚀 My long-term goal is to master JavaScript and establish crucial connections in the tech industry. I aim to contribute to the world of technology and potentially collaborate with leading companies like Google.

🌅 When I'm not diving into code, you can find me enjoying the tranquility of a sunset, strumming my guitar, or immersed in the world of gaming.
